**IronERP** is an ultra-customizable [ERP Engine](#why-engine-and-not-framework) written in
C# with a Next.js frontend.

**For temporary full documentation, please see [/docs](/docs/docs/index.md).**

#### Why "Engine" and not "Framework"?

Wikipedia defines a "Framework" as
 > a reusable set of libraries or classes for a software system or subsystem [^1]
 
whereas an "Engine" is defined as
 > A software engine is a core component of a complex software system. [^2]

IronERP is not just a collection of components. It's already a complex system in itself,
and in fact, many users will find a base install of IronERP to already fit all of their needs
as a full-featured application. On the other hand, advanced users and larger organizations will
appreciate the extreme customizability and extensibility of IronERP. Therefore we believe that
"Engine" is a more fitting category for IronERP than "Framework".
